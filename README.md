This repository contains three key folders: Implementation, CROHME PNG, and offline_chrome_png. 
The Implementation folder features modifications to Hongyu Wang’s original encoder-decoder implementation, with custom adjustments based on PALv2. 
The CROHME PNG folder explores Michael Jungo’s approach, experimenting with 256x256 PNG images and normalization, although challenges with variable-length images arose. 
The offline_chrome_png folder includes the CROHME 2016 dataset, where code was developed to convert INKML files to PNG, though accurately establishing the ground truth LaTeX proved difficult. 
All references and original MIT License files are included to preserve the integrity of the work.

Note that comprehensive list of references are included in the original report attached as well.
